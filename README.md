# ðŸ§­ MazeNavBot

This project was developed to demonstrate basic knowledge of **ROS 2 Jazzy**.  
It consists of a simple maze-like world built in **Gazebo Harmonic**, where a **TurtleBot3** navigates autonomously using a **LiDAR sensor**. The robot moves forward, detecting walls and navigating the environment based on the sensor data.

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
- ROS 2 Jazzy
- Gazebo Harmonic
- TurtleBot3
- LiDAR Sensor
- Python (control nodes)

## ðŸš€ Features
The robot:
- Detects walls using the LiDAR sensor.
- Follows walls or avoids obstacles based on implemented logic.
- Navigates through a maze-like environment.
