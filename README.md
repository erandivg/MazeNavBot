# ðŸ§­ MazeNavBot

This project was developed to demonstrate basic knowledge of **ROS 2 Jazzy**.  
It consists of a simple maze-like world built in **Gazebo Harmonic**, where a **TurtleBot3** navigates autonomously using a **LiDAR sensor**. The robot moves forward, detecting walls and navigating the environment based on the sensor data.
